# Content Hub External Components Starter

This is a starter project intended to help in the development of external components for Content Hub. It supports creating react components, as well as static vanilla javascript based components.

## Build

To build the components run

```
npm run build
```

You can also set this to run whenever a source file is changed by running

```
npm run watch
```

This will populate the `public` directory

## Run

Start the server by calling

```
npm run start
```

This will host the compiled components from the `public` directory, by default, at http://localhost:3000.
